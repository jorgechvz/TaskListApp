# Overview

As a software engineer eager to enhance my skills, I developed the Task List App, a comprehensive application that streamlines task management. This project not only serves as a personal learning endeavor but also showcases my proficiency in utilizing Firebase for authentication and Firestore as the cloud database.

The Task List App enables users to efficiently organize their tasks while harnessing the power of Firebase for user authentication. By integrating these technologies, I aim to provide a seamless and secure task management experience.

# Cloud Database

The Task List App leverages Firebase's Firestore as its cloud database. Firestore offers real-time synchronization and scalability, providing a robust foundation for storing and retrieving task-related data.

The database is structured to efficiently manage tasks for each user. Collections store user information, while documents within each collection represent individual tasks. This organized structure enhances data retrieval and ensures a seamless user experience.

# Development Environment

* Firebase: for authentication and Firestore as the cloud database.
* VS Code
* Version Control: Git
* Tailwind and bootstrap for styles
  
Programming Language: 
* Javascript

Libraries
* Firebase SDK: for integrating Firebase services.
